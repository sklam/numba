Fix 0.60.0 objectmode fallback regression due to bug in label renaming.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A regression in objectmode fallback introduced in Numba 0.60 is fixed. The issue
relates to the "label renaming" code mutating the IR directly opposed to
constructing new terminator nodes, the mutations would impact copies of the IR
as present in objectmode fallback.
